Documenting my steps while making `job-tracker`

# 1. Initial Set-Up

Just going to make a working list of my the tools, environment, etc.

- Visual Studio Code
- Node.js (along with `npm`)


# 2. Create folders and README.md

One of the first things I do when creating a project is create a `README.md` a file in markdown that describes key things one needs to know about the project.

Key things:

- Description
- How to run the project
- A live demo link if possible
- Technologies used
- Prerequisites (JDK, Java, MySQL, etc...)
- Specifications or Features of the project
- ...

Nice to have:

- Testing
- Sample Screenshots
- Sample Data
