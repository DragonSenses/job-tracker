# Instructions to run locally

- Note: You are going to need an existing [MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/), to [Get a Connection String](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/connection-string/).

**1. Clone this repo (or download zip on GitHub)**

**2. Go to the directory the files are located**

    In the terminal:

    ```powershell
    cd /job-tracker
    ```

**3. Install dependencies**

    In the terminal:

    ```powershell
    npm run install-dependencies
    ```

**4. Create an `.env` file**

Setup values for the following parameters:

- `MONGO_URL` - should be equal to your MongoDB connection string
- `SECRET_KEY` - any string that is secret to you. You can use this [Key Generator](https://www.allkeysgenerator.com/)
- `LIFETIME` - the lifetime of the JWT. This will determine a few things for the app such as for how long a user can stay logged in.
- `PORT` - is the port number you want the express server to listen to. 4000 by default.

Example of a `.env` file:

```js
MONGO_URL="Your_MongoDB_Connection_String"
SECRET_KEY="Secret_Key_You_Generated_Random_Characters"
LIFETIME="1d"
PORT=4000
```

**5. Run the app on localhost:3000**

In the terminal:
```powershell
npm run start
```

Now visit the URL: 

http://localhost:3000/
